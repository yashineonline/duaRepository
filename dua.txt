C: POSITIVITY PRAYERS

P: 
The Positivity Prayers is a summary of what we 
need daily at all levels. We should read this for 
ourselves, our family and children, or anyone that 
we need to pray for.

ST: Procedure of reciting the Positivity Prayers

P: 
We should make our connection to our heart. 
The biggest blessing from Allah is guidance. So, 
first of all we should pray for ourselves and our 
family, and even our enemies to have guidance to 
the truth with ease. So, by directing our intention 
to the person that we are praying for, we can do 
the following zikr:

Ya Hadi Ya Haqq Ya Latif

F:
Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

Alhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘alamin

Ar Rahmanir Rahim

Maliki Yawmid Din

Iyaka na’budu wa iyaka nasta’in

Ihdinas sirat al mustaqim

Siratallazina an ‘amta ‘alayhim, 
ghayril maghdubi ‘alayhim walad daalin 

(Amin)

T:
Al Fatiha: The Opening
In the name of Allah, The One Who Acts with Mercy, The Source of Mercy.
All gratitude and praise belong to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The One Who Acts with Mercy, The Source of Mercy.
The Owner of the Dominion on Judgment Day.
We connect and devote ourselves to You, 
and we ask for Your help.
Guide us to the confirmed and sure path.
The path of those on whom You have bestowed Your grace, not of those who deserve Your wrath nor of those who misguide themselves. 
(Amen)

C: PROTECTION PRAYERS

QI:
Sura Al Ikhlas

Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

Qul Hu Allahu Ahad 

Allahus - Samad

Lam yalid wa lam yulad

Wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan Ahad

T:
Al Ikhlas: Sincerity and Salvation

In the name of Allah, The One Who Acts with Mercy, The Source of Mercy. 

Say, “He, Allah, is Ahad [Unique; Formless], 

Allah is Al Samad [The Administrator of All 
Manifestation]. 

He does not give birth, nor is He born, 

and nothing is equal to Ahad.”

I:Sura Al Ikhlas helps us to shift our focus from the self to Allah. It is an excellent zikr to realize and affirm Allah’s Oneness. Illusion must dissolve to reveal Truth. It is recommended to recite this Sura regularly, day and night.

QF:
Sura Al Falaq

Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

Qul a’uzubi Rabbil falaq

Min sharri ma khalaq

Wa min sharri ghasiqin iza waqab

Wa min sharrin - naffaasaati fil uqad

Wa min sharri haasidin iza hasad

T:
Al Falaq: The Daybreak 

In the name of Allah, The One Who Acts 
with Mercy, The Source of Mercy. 
Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak, 
From the evil of what He created, 
And from the affliction of the darkness 
when it intensifies, 
And from the negativity 
of those who blow on knots (doing evil magic), 
And from the harm of the envious ones 
when they act with envy.”

QN:
Sura Al Naas 

Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

Qul a’uzubi Rabbin naas

Malikin naas 

Ilahin naas

Min sharril waswaasil khan–naas

Allazi yu–waswisu fi sudurin–naas

Minal jinnati wan–naas

T:
Al Naas: Humankind

In the name of Allah, The One Who Acts 
with Mercy, The Source of Mercy. 
Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind, 
Ruler of humankind, 
The Highest Power of humankind, 
From the evil of the one who whispers and runs, 
The ones who whisper (negativity) 
into the chests of human beings, 
Whether they be of jinn or humans.”

C: Sealing Prayer

QAK:
Ayat al Kursi (Throne Verse)
Allahu la ilaha illa Hu 
Al Hayy ul Qayyum
La ta’khuzuhu sinatun wa la nawm
Lahu ma fis–samawati wa ma fil ard
Man zallazi yashfa’u indahu illa bi–iznih
Ya’lamu ma bayna aydihim 
wa ma khalfahum
Wa la yuhituna bi shay–in min ilmihi illa bima shaa
Wasi’a Kursiy yuhus–samawati wal ard
Wa la ya–uduhu hifzuhuma 
Wa Hu wal Aliy ul Azim

T:
Translation of Ayat al Kursi
Allah, there is no higher power besides Him,
Al Hayy, Al Qayyum. 
Neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him. 
Whatever is in the universes and on earth 
belongs to Him. 
There is no one who can intercede with Him
except by His permission. 
He knows what is ahead of them 
and what is behind them, 
And they can comprehend (or have access to) 
nothing of His knowledge or science 
except as He allows. 
His Kursi [Throne] encompasses the universes 
and the earth, 
And He is never tired of protecting and preserving them, 
And He is Al Ali, Al Azim.

I:
There are many benefits of reciting Ayat al Kursi. To protect yourself against jinn [hidden beings], the unseen evil things, and the evil things happening in the world today, you need to learn and repeat Ayat al Kursi, The Throne Verse. It is verse 255 of Sura Al Baqara.

C: Cleansing Prayer

QY:
Sura Ya Sin, Ayats 1 – 12 
Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim
Ya Sin 
Wal Qur’anil Hakim 
Innaka la minal mursalin 
Ala siratin mustaqim 
Tanzilal Azizir Rahim 
Li tunzira qawman ma unzira aba uhum 
fahum ghafilun
Laqad haqqal qawlu ala aksarihim 
fahum la yu’minun
Inna ja’alna fi a’naqihim aghlaalan fahiya ilal azqani fahum muqmahun
Wa ja’alna mim bayni aydihim 
saddan wa min khalfihim 
saddan fa aghshay naahum fahum la yubsirun
Wa sawa un alayhim a-anzartahum 
am lam tunzirhum la yu’minun
Innama tunziru manittaba‘az zikra 
wa khashiyar Rahmana bil ghayb 
Fabash shir-hu bi maghfiratin wa ajrin karim
Inna nahnu nuhyil mawta 
wa naktubu ma qaddamu wa aasaarahum 
Wa kulla shay-in ahsaynaahu fi imamin mubin

T:
Translation of Sura Ya Sin, Verses 1 – 12 
In the name of Allah, The One Who Acts with Mercy, The Source of Mercy.
Ya Sin. 
By the wise Qur’an, indeed, you are one of the messengers on a confirmed and sure path, sent down by Al Aziz, Al Rahim, that you may warn a community whose fathers were not warned. Therefore, they are heedless. Already the utterance of the truth has come to most of them, yet they do not believe. Indeed, We have placed iron collars on their necks reaching their chins, so that their necks are stiffened. And We have placed a barrier before them and behind them, and they are obstructed, so they cannot see. And whether you warn them or not, it is all the same for them — they will not believe. You can only warn the one who follows the Zikr [Qur’an; Reminder], and who shows awe of and respect to Al Rahman in secret (not to show
off). Give them news of absolution and a generous reward. Surely, it is We Who give life to the dead, and We record every step they take and every imprint of what they did. And We have kept all things in a clear book of reference.
