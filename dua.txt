POSITIVITY PRAYERS

The Positivity Prayers is a summary of what we 
need daily at all levels. We should read this for 
ourselves, our family and children, or anyone that 
we need to pray for.

Procedure of reciting the Positivity Prayers

We should make our connection to our heart. 
The biggest blessing from Allah is guidance. So, 
first of all we should pray for ourselves and our 
family, and even our enemies to have guidance to 
the truth with ease. So, by directing our intention 
to the person that we are praying for, we can do 
the following zikr:

Ya Hadi Ya Haqq Ya Latif
